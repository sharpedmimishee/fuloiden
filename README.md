# fuloiden
A editor for synthesis audio.
## Why did you start to make this?
This project was created before this repository was created because I just wanted it. That's all.  
As for its name, fistly I thought that I would name the project Synthefuloid.  
However I thought the name is not good with some reason(too long, similar to other softwares, etc.). Thus I decided to change the name.   
Secondly, I decided to name the project Synthefulen, but I didn't think that Synthe- prefix is good.  
So I took some parts(ful, oid and en) from both unused names, and I combine them.  
Please don't think that I forgot better English :)
